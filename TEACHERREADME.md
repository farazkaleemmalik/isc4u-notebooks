# Hello, and welcome to ICS4U on Jupyter Notebook!

This is the teacher guide for grading/commenting on tests.

## Intro

This course is divided into 3 topics. In terms of grading, each topic has one test. Most of the questions are autograded, needing no manual grading, but a few do. This guide will take you through the grading process of the three tasks.

### Recommended Assignment Time
1. Topic 1 - 1 week
2. Topic 2 - 1 week
3. Topic 3 - 1 week

### Recommended Test Duration
1. Topic 1 - 15 mins
2. Topic 2 - 15 mins
3. Topic 3 - 15 mins

## Grading

To start of, go to the Home directory (by clicking the Jupyter logo on the top left corner of the screen) in another Tab. You will see many files and directories at this stage, but click the Formgrader tab on the toolbar above the large box wil all of the files.

This will open a new tab, with the page listing all 3 assignments for this course. When the time comes to grade them (based on how you set the due dates), click on "Collect", then on the number 1 in the "# Submissions" column when it appears. This will take you to the Submission page, showing the student's submission. Click autograde (the lightning bolt). After the popup with console output, click OK, and if the test has any manual grading options, the status oft the submission will be "needs manual grading" instead of "graded". If the status is graded, great! You are done, so record the grade onto your gradebook (it will be on the page). If not, then go over to "Manual Grading" on the leftmost column of the page.

This will take you to a similar page, so click on the exact assignment you will be grading, and then on "Test". This will take you to the Submission page, so click on the only submission there (if there is one) and you will be taken to the Manual Grader.

## Manual Grading

The manual grader will show each question on the test along with the response from the student. You can ignore all of the autograded questions and only determine scores for the text based answers, usually the first question(s). Use the "TestAnswers.ipynb" document to see criteria for grading the manual questions. On the blue bar above the question, adjust the score for each question, then click next, in the top right corner. The "Overall Score" of the submission will be the final score. You are done!
